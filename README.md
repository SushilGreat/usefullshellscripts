# usefullshellscripts
This Repo contains funny Bash Scripts. I write them all the time to make my daily tasks very easy. 
Sometimes I need them once but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see them ;)

### Github Repo 
Download all your repos from Github, while maintaining the original datetimes (upload, edit etc) 
It places them inside a json in your repo root, with a side note in README.md.
Becaerful: it creates or writes to the README.md (therefore it's possible that you experience a few side effects) 

### FindFile 
It's a very nice Tool to find text in files non-recursively without the need to open VS Code or smth. like that

### DoInstall 
uses docker-compose to setup a Env for the Mondial Database (if you're studying informatics it could be you need it)

### GetIP
The fast way to find your external IP. (Needs inet connection)
